**Splunk Firewall Dashboard**

Greetings, everyone! In this repository, I will delve into the intricacies of creating a Firewall dashboard using Splunk.

**Splunk** is a powerful tool designed for log analysis, simplifying tasks such as data collection, management, sorting, and searching. Within the Splunk tool, we employ SPL _(Search Processing Language)_ to navigate and query the data. You can install Splunk from the official website, and a free version is available.

For the Firewall log, I sourced data from a GitHub repository. 

Upon obtaining data, the first crucial step is to determine its structureâ€”whether it is structured or unstructured. In my case, the data is structured, and extensive, and has been divided into two files. Both files have been uploaded to Splunk.

**Getting Data In:**

1. Login into Splunk (I am using the cloud version, it can be a local one too with a free or enterprise version)
