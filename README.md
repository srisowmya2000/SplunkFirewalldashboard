# Splunk Firewall dashboard


Hello guys, In this repo I will be discussing the Firewall dashboard. I will use SPLUNK to build the dashboard. 

SPLUNK - It is a tool used for log analysis. It simplifies the task of collecting data, managing data, sorting data, and searching through the data. In the Splunk tool we use SPL is a search-processing language that is used to search in the data in Splunk.
Install SPLUNK from the SPlunk website(there is a free version available too).

For the Firewall log, I have used data that I got on one GitHub repo[1] 

The first and foremost thing to do when you get data is to observe whether the data is structured or Unstructured. If the fields are extracted from the data.
